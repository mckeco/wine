In the pursuit of understanding the intricate relationship between climate and wine, this project endeavors to develop an application that tracks climate conditions alongside consumer ratings and flavor profiles of wines. Leveraging data extracted from Vivino and climate databases, the project undertakes extensive data wrangling and analysis to unveil insights into consumer preferences and climate influences. Through meticulous data organization and manipulation, coupled with the power of SQL and visualization tools like Tableau, the project aims to offer a comprehensive platform for exploring the interplay between climate, grape cultivation, and wine characteristics. By focusing initially on Napa Valley and Cabernet Sauvignon wines, this project sets the stage for broader insights into how climate shapes the flavors and structures of wines across different regions and vineyards, ultimately empowering stakeholders in the wine industry with deeper insights into wine production and consumer preferences.
